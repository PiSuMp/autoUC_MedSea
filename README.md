### Step by step - Transect by different Methods
1. Clone the repository
2. Open '.03_R_Scripts/analyzePresenceAbsence.R'
3. Install packages
4. Change the threshold file on line 37 if different than 0.8
5. Optional: If you want to save the graph in a PDF uncomment line 266
6. Run all the lines and enjoy the graphs
